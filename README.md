# Code-Quiz
Test your skills with this Quiz all about JavaScript, built mostly by JavaScript!

## The Goal for this application:

* To have a functional JavaSctip quiz that can be completed on any platform from Desktop to mobile devices.

* To allow for users to test their basic JavaScript knowledge and challenge themselves to compete for their fastest time via a hiscores page.

* Make that hiscores page store locally and be clear-able.

* Have the hiscore determined by the time remaining... if you answer a question incorrectly the time will be reduced by 15 seconds as a penalty to prevent spam guessing wrong answers to achieve the fastest completion.

* I want the user to have a smooth, enjoyable experience with the applicaiton! Click [HERE] (Placeholder link) to give it a try!
